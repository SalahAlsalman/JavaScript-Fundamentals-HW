### Variables
- Calculate area of a rectangle
    - Store the length of rectangle. 
    - Store the width of rectangle.
    - Calculate the area and print the output "The area of the rectangle is: NN" 
    
- The Temperature Converter  
    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
# JavaScript conditions and loops HWs

## For loop
### Numbers' summations
* Loop though this array `let Numbers = [23,54,32,87,47]` and print the sum of all numbers

### Maximum number
- Create an array of the following numbers [16,4,2,0,19,6]
- Loop through the array elements and print the maximum number of this list to the console.

### Reverse Array 
- Create an array of the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
- print the array in a reverse order


## Nested for loop


### stars pattern
- Declare a variable and assign a number to it.
- Print a right angle triangle using stars to the console. Example: if the variable is 5, the printed pattern will be as follow:

\* <br>
\** <br>
\*** <br>
\**** <br>
\***** <br>
